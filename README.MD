# MS1 - User-Centric Frontend Development for Code Institute
##  Band Website for Deftones
I decided to make a website for my favourite band Deftones. For this project I took inspiration from their existing website but took it in my own direction by creating a custom theme and styling. 
I also looked at some of my other favourite bands websites for inspiration. I tried to rewrite information on the band where possible and linked to actual articles about the band in the cases that were based on real events. 

## User Experience goals
My goal with this website was to make it easy for fans of the band to find important information such as live tour information, promotions, merchendise, streaming content and information about the members. The typical user would want to quickly gain access to the bands music or gig information. A returning user may want to purchase merchendise or sign up for the fan mailing list. A user from a venue or promotion company may want to get in touch with band management or book the band for a gig. Therefor I have made 4 destinct pages covering everything the average user may need.

### Website Sections

#### Theme and style
I have used two fonts for my website. Lobster and Long Cang, both Google fonts. Lobster closely resembles the actual font used by the band in the logo image I decided to use and long cang resembles the freehend a lyricist may use while scribbling ideas in a notebook. As is customary with the band I have used a white and black theme however I have used varying shades of red to highlight links, headings and navigation items. I fell it keeps the minimalist theme while cutting through the manotony of black and white. I decided to make the background solid black and leave all the secions transparent with just a white border at the top of each element. I feel it suits the minimalist aesthetic while clearly defining element sections. 

#### Navigation bar
I decided to not use the standard bootstrap navbar layout opting instead to have a circular band logo center and have the nav links on either side. I fell this seperates my site from the standard bootsrap navbar look. I also applied custom colors, animations and fonts.

#### Footer
For the footer I decided to keep it clean and minimalistic having only Font Awesome icons with animations to the bands social media sites. All links link to the bands official social media

#### Home
The home page has a carosel displaying images and important updates about the new album as well as tour information and links to sign up to the fan list or stream the new single via buttons and icons.
Under the carosel there are 3 sections with tour dates, band news and achievements as well as a link to the official merch store.
The last section has a link to a limited edition(fictional) collection of vinyl signed by the band as well as a button to buy the collection.

#### Media
The media page has 2 responsive embedded youtube videos with a button linking to the bands official youtube page. I have also included an embedded Spotify player with the bands top music as well as a button that links to their spotify discography. The discography section I decided to use bootstrap flip-cards with the bands album covers, upon hovering over an album cover the card flips to reveal a brief description of each album as well as links to stream that album. I have decided to not display the flip cards on small devices as it appears really squashed and did not look good on mobile, not to mention it would mean endless scrolling on such a small screen. I did add a button to purchase the bands discography on mobile.

#### Contact
For the contact page I kept it simple and added 3 sections. The first section is a form to sign up to the mailing list with place for email address and a few check boxes to make sure the user has read the terms and conditions, is over 18 and would like to recieve promotional communications. The middle section is details relating to band management and an embedded google map with the management companies location. The last section is a form for booking the band which includes a date picker and various required fields followed by a submit button. 

#### Bio 
For the bio page I created divs in a 2 1 2 formation with the name and instrument of each member, the images on each section grow and change from greyscale to color when hovered over. I used bootstraps accordion to make a drop down section when the user clicks more info. This drops down and reveals information about the band member as well as a link to their respective wikipedia page.
